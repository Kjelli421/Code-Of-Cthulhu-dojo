The Code of Cthulhu: Black-Box Penetration Testing Dojo

    A modular, containerized dojo built for training offensive security skills through real-world web application vulnerabilities.

About the Project

The Code of Cthulhu is a black-box penetration testing platform designed for students, ethical hackers, and security professionals to practice and refine their skills in a safe, controlled environment.

Built as part of a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at Noroff University College, the project simulates realistic attack scenarios using a containerized web application stack.
